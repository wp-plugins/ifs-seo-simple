Purpose of this plugin is to do some simple on site search engine optimization.

== Description ==

This plugin is intended to make on site SEO very simple, not necessarily easy. The basic idea is to add the meta keywords and the meta description tag to your pages and posts.

Next to adding the meta keywords and meta description tag it also has the option to override the default title of your post and/or display clean titles without the site name.

More information about the background of the plugin in the IFS SEO Simple main screen. Just download and install. The plugin won't change anything before you configure it, so you can install it safely. You will only see some additional fields in the edit screen, but if left empty they don't do anything.

== Installation ==

The IFS Simple SEO module does not require any specific installation, except just download from Wordpress and install yourself or use the Wordpress installer.

You will first need to configure e.g. default title, keywords and description in the configuration screen before anything will change in the site.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

We don't know, but nobody really knows how Google ranks sites, not even the Google engineers as one may presume everything is automated.

We left options for you to decide, like whether to use standard Wordpress titles or not.

== Screenshots ==

No screenshots needed. Just standard Wordpress.
